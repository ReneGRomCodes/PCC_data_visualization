# Data Visualization Project

This project is based on the data visualization chapters (15, 16, and 17) from the book Python Crash Course.

## Overview

The project covers various aspects of data visualization in Python, including generating data, downloading data, and
working with APIs. The primary libraries used are `matplotlib.pyplot` for basic plotting, `pygal` for interactive SVG
charts, and functionalities for handling CSV, JSON formats, and APIs.

## Chapters Covered

### Chapter 15: Generating Data

- **Plotting Graphs:** Demonstrates how to plot simple line graphs using `matplotlib.pyplot`.
- **Scatterplots:** Illustrates the creation of scatterplots to visualize relationships between variables.
- **Histograms:** Shows how to create histograms to visualize distributions of data.

### Chapter 16: Downloading Data

- **CSV Format:** Covers reading data from CSV files and visualizing it.
- **JSON Format:** Demonstrates reading data from JSON files and visualizing it.

### Chapter 17: Working with APIs

- **Using APIs:** Introduces working with APIs, making requests, and processing responses.
- **Visualizing API Data:** Shows how to use data obtained from APIs and visualize it.

## Installation

To run the code examples in this project, you need Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install
the required libraries using pip:
