# Exercise 16-5 All Countries: On the population map we made in this section, our program couldn't automatically find
# two-letter codes for about 12 countries. Work out which countries are missing codes and look through the
# 'COUNTRIES' dictionary for the codes. Add an 'if-elif-else' block to 'get_country_code()' so it returns the
# correct country code values for these specific countries.


# Exercise 16-6 Gross Domestic Product: Download the JSON version of the GDP data set from the 'Open Knowledge
# Foundation' and plot the GDP for each country in the world for the most recent year in the dataset.


# Exercise 16-7 Choose Your Own Data: The World Bank maintains data sets that are broken down for information on each
# country worldwide. Go to http://www.data.worldbank.org/indicator and find a data set that looks interesting and
# download it as CSV file. Write a program that generates a dictionary with Pygal's two-letter country codes as its keys
# and your chosen data from the file as its values, then plot the data on a 'Worldmap' and style the map as you like.


# Exercise 16-8 Testing the 'country_codes' Module: When we wrote the 'country_codes' module, we used 'print' statements
# to check whether the 'get_country_code()' function worked. Wrote a proper test for this function using what you
# learned in chapter 11.
